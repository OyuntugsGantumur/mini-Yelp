## mini-Yelp

This project aims to design and implement data structures (ArrayList and BinaryTree) in C and build a program with features of the Yelp app. The program reads the restaurant information from a txt file, stores the data, and queries the user for commands. The commands the user can enter to search and manipulate the data are:

- search (AND, OR, * operators can be used)
- add
- remove
- modify
- print
- write
- exit

For each command, the user will be queried to enter the necessary parameters.

## Input file

Each restaurant in the knowledge base has the following information:
- restaurant name
- city
- food type(s), separated by a comma (e.g. Chinese, vegetarian, Italian)
- hours and days of operation
- cost ($, $$, $$$)
- review, ranging from 0 to 5
- number of reviews
